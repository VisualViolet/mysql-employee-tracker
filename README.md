## Description
MySQL Employee Tracker is a command-line application built with Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. MySQL was a welcome addition to our UW Coding Bootcamp cirriculum, as I first learned about SQL using SQL Server Management Stuio. SQL is an amazing tool for storing and querying information. When combined with Node.js and Inquirer, we can create an interactive database, such as this one that tracks employee data. This is a great tool to use to easily query, create, update, and delete information, especially when working with large quantities of data! The console will guide you and SQL will do all the work. In building this application, I learned the value of combining SQL with a user interface to create an easy way for users to access and manipulate their data.

## Installation

Since this is a command-line application, there will be no live deployment. Please view a live demonstration of this app here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-3SRhv32EkyPbBooeG6-uJu9TdaYoXkd/view.


## Usage

MySQL Employee Tracker was designed to keep track of employee data by querying a database. View, add, and update employees, departments, and roles! To start this application, we enter the command "node index.js" into our integrated terminal. The application will automatically begin and ask you to pick a task. Once selected, simply follow the prompts and allow MySQL to do the rest! Students and new developers may also find usefulness in the code of this application to see how MySQL, Node.js, and JavaScript work together to form an interactive database. Code has been commented to describe functionality.
